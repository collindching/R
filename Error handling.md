## Conditions

Conditions are a type of R object used to manage unusual conditions like errors, warnings, and messages() condition system allows a function to signal that something unusual is happening. Functions signal conditions with the following functions:

- `stop()` for errors
- `warning()` for warnings
- `message()` for messages

These conditions can then be handled separately. 

## Condition Handling

In R, expected errors occur most often when you're fitting different models, causing some models to occasionally fail.

There are three tools to handle errors programmatically:
- `try()` ignores errors
- `tryCatch()` lets you control what happens when an error occurs
- `withCallingHandlers()` is a special variant of `tryCatch()

#### tryCatch()

`tryCatch()` is typically used to handle error conditions, and allows you to override default behavior. 


map conditions to handlers, which are named functions that are called with the condition as an input. If a condition is signalled, tryCatch() will map condi
